1. Pre-requisites
------------------

  Our software requires the availability of the BLAS and LAPACK
  libraries. If you do not have them installed in your system,
  you can freely downloaded them from:

  * BLAS: http://xianyi.github.com/OpenBLAS/
  * LAPACK: http://netlib.org/lapack/#_software
  
  Their installation is typically rather straightforward.


2. Compiling
-------------

  The file make.inc sets a number of environment variables
  necessary for the compilation. We provide a number of examples
  of this file in the inc/ directory, for different combinations
  of architectures, compilers, and libraries. You can choose the
  most suitable and overwrite the file make.inc with it.
  For instance, if you chose to install the BLAS and LAPACK libraries 
  linked above in a linux machine, select the file "make.inc.gnu-goto".
  You will need to set the paths to the aforementioned libraries
  in your system.
  
  Once the make.inc file is ready, you can compile the code.
  Simply type "make" and it will create the binaries "CLAK-GWAS"
  and "reshuffle" in the bin/ directory.
