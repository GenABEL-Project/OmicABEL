1. Who is Who
--------------

In the bin/ directory you can find the following executables:

* CLAK-GWAS: the program to run GWAS analyses (through CLAK-Chol or CLAK-Eig)
* reshuffle: the program to extract the output of CLAK-GWAS into text format

The output produced by CLAK-GWAS is kept in a compact binary format
for performance reasons. The user can then use "reshuffle" to
extract the desired information. Since the output may be very large,
reshuffle allows the selection of specific ranges of SNPs and traits.


2. Preparing your data
-----------------------

Currently, CLAK-GWAS only accepts as input data files in DenABEL 
(filevector) format.
In the tutorial available in the project's webpage:

http://www.genabel.org/packages/OmicABEL

you can find an example of how to transform your data into filevector.
If you need help, don't hesitate contacting us or ask for help at the

3. Running GWAS analyses
-------------------------

The example in the tutorial also provides a basic example on using OmicABEL
to run your GWAS analyses. Here we detail the options of CLAK-GWAS. 
The complete list of options for CLAK-GWAS is avaliable through the command

./CLAK-GWAS -h

Usage: CLAK-GWAS [options]

Following options may be given:

  -var     [chol | eigen] Default is chol.
  -cov     base path to covariates file 
  -phi     base path to kinship matrix file 
  -snp     base path to SNPs file 
  -pheno   base path to phenotypes file 
  -out     base path to output file 
  -nths    # Default is 1 thread.
  -thres   # Default is 95%.
  -h       Show this help and exit

* The option "-var" selects the algorithm to use:
   "chol" forces CLAK-GWAS to use the CLAK-Chol algorithm (recommended for 
          single-phenotype GWAS).
   "eigen" forces CLAK-GWAS to use the CLAK-Eig algorithms (recommended for
          multiple-phenotype GWAS).

* "-cov", "-phi", "-snp", "-pheno" are used to indicate the input files
          for the analysis. If the covariates are stored in the pair of
          file "covs.fvd" and "covs.fvi", the option -cov
          is used as: "-cov covs". Same for the other three options.

* "-out" is used to indicate the output file(s)

* "-nths" allows the user to indicate how many cores to use.

* "-thres" is the acceptable proportion of missing values 
           (these are imputed by means, therefore our suggestion 
		   is to keep this threshold at 95 at minimum).


Options without a default value (-cov, -phi, -snp, -pheno, -out)
are mandatory.
